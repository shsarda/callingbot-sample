# Track participants in the call by adding Bot to Teams Meeting

## Summary
This sample code shows how to track participants in the call by adding a Calling & Meeting bot. 
Samples are generally not production-ready or an out-of-the-box solution but are intended to show developers specific patterns for use in their applications. The functionality is bare bone, all it does is tracks participants in the call once the bot is added to the meeting.
